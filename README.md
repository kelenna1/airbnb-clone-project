# airbnb-clone-project

## Overview
This project aims to build a clone of the Airbnb platform, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. The goal is to create a robust booking platform that demonstrates modern full-stack development practices.

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Django
- Database: MySQL
- API: RESTful with potential GraphQL endpoints
- Deployment: Docker with CI/CD pipelines

## Team Roles

### Backend Developer
Responsible for implementing server-side logic, API endpoints, and integrating with the database. Works closely with frontend developers to ensure proper data flow.

### Database Administrator
Designs and maintains the database schema, optimizes queries, and ensures data integrity and security.

### DevOps Engineer
Sets up and maintains CI/CD pipelines, manages deployment environments, and ensures smooth deployment processes.

### Security Specialist
Implements authentication, authorization, and other security measures to protect user data and system integrity.

### Project Manager
Coordinates between team members, tracks progress, and ensures project milestones are met.


## Technology Stack

### Django
A high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable backend systems. Used for building RESTful APIs and handling business logic.

### MySQL
A relational database management system used to store and manage all application data including users, properties, bookings, etc.

### GraphQL
A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching of data.

### Docker
A containerization platform used to package the application and its dependencies into containers for consistent deployment across environments.

### GitHub Actions
A CI/CD platform integrated with GitHub to automate testing and deployment workflows.


## Database Design

### Users
- id (Primary Key)
- username
- email
- password_hash
- created_at
Relationships: One-to-many with Properties (host), Bookings (guest), Reviews

### Properties
- id (Primary Key)
- title
- description
- price_per_night
- host_id (Foreign Key to Users)
Relationships: Many-to-one with Users, One-to-many with Bookings, Reviews

### Bookings
- id (Primary Key)
- property_id (Foreign Key to Properties)
- guest_id (Foreign Key to Users)
- check_in_date
- check_out_date
- total_price
Relationships: Many-to-one with Users and Properties

### Reviews
- id (Primary Key)
- property_id (Foreign Key to Properties)
- author_id (Foreign Key to Users)
- rating
- comment
- created_at
Relationships: Many-to-one with Users and Properties


## Feature Breakdown

### User Management
Allows users to register, login, and manage their profiles. Essential for personalizing the experience and securing user data.

### Property Management
Enables hosts to create, update, and manage property listings. Core functionality for the marketplace aspect of the platform.

### Booking System
Handles reservation creation, modification, and cancellation. The central feature that facilitates transactions between guests and hosts.

### Review System
Allows guests to leave reviews and ratings for properties they've stayed at. Builds trust in the platform through user-generated content.

### Search and Filtering
Enables users to find properties based on location, price, amenities, etc. Critical for user experience and engagement.


## API Security

### Authentication
JWT (JSON Web Tokens) will be implemented to verify user identity. Essential for protecting user accounts and personal data.

### Authorization
Role-based access control to ensure users can only access resources they have permission to. Prevents unauthorized actions.

### Rate Limiting
Restricts the number of API calls a user can make in a given time period. Protects against brute force attacks and DDoS.

### Data Validation
Input sanitization and validation to prevent SQL injection and other injection attacks. Critical for database security.

### HTTPS
All communications will be encrypted using TLS/SSL. Protects data in transit from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
